# Integrated Project: Access to Drinking Water  

## Project Overview  
This project transforms raw survey data into meaningful insights about access to drinking water in underserved communities. Using Google Sheets, we clean, model, and visualize data to highlight infrastructure gaps, safety concerns, and usage patterns.  

---

## Objectives  
- *Data Cleaning & Structuring*: Organize and refine survey data using Google Sheets.  
- *Data Modeling*: Build interconnected sheets to simulate a relational data model.  
- *Visualization*: Create charts and dashboards to reveal trends in water source usage, safety, and accessibility.  
- *Decision Support*: Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for infrastructure planning.

## Tools & Technologies  

### Primary Tools  
- *Google Sheets*: Data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization.  
- *Survey Data*: Primary source of information on water access and safety.  

### Functions & Techniques  
- *Formulas & Functions*: VLOOKUP, QUERY, ARRAYFORMULA, IMPORTRANGE, and more.  
- *Charts*: Column, pie, line, and geo charts for visual storytelling.
