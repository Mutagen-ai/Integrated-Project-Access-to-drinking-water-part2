Integrated Project: Access to Drinking Water
Project Overview
This project transforms raw survey data into meaningful insights about access to drinking water in underserved communities. Using Google Sheets, we clean, model, and visualize data to highlight infrastructure gaps, safety concerns, and usage patterns.

Objectives
Clean and structure water access data using Google Sheets

Build interconnected sheets to simulate a relational data model

Create charts and dashboards that reveal trends in water source usage, safety, and accessibility

Empower stakeholders with data-driven insights for infrastructure planning

Tools & Technologies
Google Sheets: Data cleaning, transformation, modeling, and visualization

Formulas & Functions: VLOOKUP, QUERY, ARRAYFORMULA, IMPORTRANGE, etc.

Charts: Column, pie, line, and geo charts for visual storytelling

Survey Data: Primary source of information on water access and safety

Key Features
Water Source Distribution Sheet Tracks frequency and types of water sources across regions.

Safety & Accessibility Sheet Maps crime incidents and gender-based risks during water collection.

Queue Dynamics Sheet Analyzes wait times and crowding at shared water points.

Pollution Mapping Sheet Displays contamination levels of wells and taps across provinces.

Insights Delivered
Gender disparities in water collection responsibilities

Correlation between crime rates and water access points

Identification of high-risk zones for water pollution

Patterns in queue lengths and peak collection times
